# Build scripts are useful when one needs to perform some set of actions at build time.
# Typical uses are building/linking to external C libraries or doing some sort of code generation before building a project. 
# By placing a file named build.rs in the root of our project directory, weâ€™re telling cargo to compile and execute build.rs just before building our project.
